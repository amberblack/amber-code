# Amber Syntax Highlighting

Amber is an elegant templating engine for Go Programming Language. It is inspired by HAML and Jade.

As far as I can tell there aren't any Code extensions to put syntax highlighting on .amber documents, so I copied over this one that [okamoai](https://github.com/okamoai/sublime-amber) made for Sublime.

## Features

Provides syntax highlighting for Amber templates.
